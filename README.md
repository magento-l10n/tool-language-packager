Tool to create Composer package based on translation sources.

Initial implementation MAY be based on `magento i18n:pack` CLI command and build with Symfony Console component. But final decision on technology stack and implementation is up to the working group.

Tool should provide CLI command to create Magento language package based on translation repository sources like [i18n-magento2](https://github.com/magento-l10n/i18n-magento2) optionally packed as zip archive.
